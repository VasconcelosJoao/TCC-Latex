@article{McCall2019,
	abstract = {The types of programming errors that novice programmers make and struggle to resolve have long been of interest to researchers. Various past studies have analyzed the frequency of compiler diagnostic messages. This information, however, does not have a direct correlation to the types of errors students make, due to the inaccuracy and imprecision of diagnostic messages. Furthermore, few attempts have been made to determine the severity of different kinds of errors in terms other than frequency of occurrence. Previously, we developed a method for meaningful categorization of errors, and produced a frequency distribution of these error categories; in this article, we extend the previous method to also make a determination of error difficulty, in order to give a better measurement of the overall severity of different kinds of errors. An error category hierarchy was developed and validated, and errors in snapshots of students source code were categorized accordingly. The result is a frequency table of logical error categories rather than diagnostic messages. Resolution time for each of the analyzed errors was calculated, and the average resolution time for each category of error was determined; this defines an error difficulty score. The combination of frequency and difficulty allow us to identify the types of error that are most problematic for novice programmers. The results show that ranking errors by severity-a product of frequency and difficulty-yields a significantly different ordering than ranking them by frequency alone, indicating that error frequency by itself may not be a suitable indicator for which errors are actually the most problematic for students.},

@article{Jose2023,
	abstract = {Databases have a large amount of information that can be accessed by the structured query language (SQL), but this language requires technical knowledge. An alternative to facilitating access to this information is to use natural language to make queries, and an artificial intelligence model to translate to SQL. Transformer-based language models have been incredibly successful in this regard. However, transformers are limited by the size of the input text; therefore, long sentences can interfere with the quality of the results. We present two techniques to improve results. The first is an innovative technique that allows long-text sequences to be handled by transformers with up to 512 input tokens. We run database schema pruning (removal of table names and column names that are useless for the query of interest) during a fine-tuning process. The second technique is a multilingual approach. The model is fine-tuned using a data-augmented Spider dataset [a specialized dataset for Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL)] in four languages simultaneously: English, Portuguese, Spanish, and French. The combination of these techniques allowed an increase in the exact set match accuracy results from 0.718 to 0.736 in our validation dataset. The process of improving results is challenging because NL2SQL techniques are already significantly optimized, and the two techniques presented here are important because they are applied in the training dataset, allowing them to be used with any current technique. Source code, evaluations, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/C4AI/gap-text2sql .},

While previous research has investigated the errors made by novices during SQL query formulation, the underlying causes for these errors have remained unexplored. Understanding the basic misconceptions held by novices which lead to these errors would help improve how we teach query languages to our students. In this paper we aim to identify the misconceptions that might be the causes of documented SQL errors that novices make. To this end, we conducted a qualitative think-aloud study to gather information on the thinking process of university students while solving query formulation problems. With the queries in hand, we analyzed the underlying causes for the errors made by our participants. In this paper we present the identified SQL misconceptions organized into four top-level categories: misconceptions based in previous course knowledge, generalization-based misconceptions, language-based misconceptions, and misconceptions due to an incomplete or incorrect mental model. A deep exploration of misconceptions can uncover gaps in instruction. By drawing attention to these, we aim to improve SQL education.},

abstract = {Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed. Changes in data representation will often be needed as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.Existing noninferential, formatted data systems provide users with tree-structured files or slightly more general network models of the data. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced. In Section 2, certain operations on relations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model.},

address = {USA},
abstract = {From the Preface (See Front Matter for full Preface)An important adjunct to precision is a sound theoretical foundation. The relational model is solidly based on two parts of mathematics: firstorder predicate logic and the theory of relations. This book, however, does not dwell on the theoretical foundations, but rather on all the features of the relational model that I now perceive as important for database users, and therefore for DBMS vendors. My perceptions result from 20 years of practical experience in computing and data processing (chiefly, but not exclusively, with large-scale customers of IBM), followed by another 20 years of research.I believe that this is the first book to deal exclusively with the relational approach. It does, however, include design principles in Chapters 21 and 22. It is also the first book on the relational model by the originator of that model. All the ideas in the relational model described in this book are mine, except in cases where I explicitly credit someone else.In developing the relational model, I have tried to follow Einstein's advice, "Make it as simple as possible, but no simpler." I believe that in the last clause he was discouraging the pursuit of simplicity to the extent of distorting reality. So why does the book contain 30 chapters and two appendixes? To answer this question, it is necessary to look at the history of research and development of the relational model.}

Transaction processing techniques are deeply ingrained in the fields of databases and operating systems and are used to monitor, control and update information in modern computer systems. This book will show you how large, distributed, heterogeneous computer systems can be made to work reliably. Using transactions as a unifying conceptual framework, the authors show how to build high-performance distributed systems and high-availability applications with finite budgets and risk. The authors provide detailed explanations of why various problems occur as well as practical, usable techniques for their solution. Throughout the book, examples and techniques are drawn from the most successful commercial and research systems. Extensive use of compilable C code fragments demonstrates the many transaction processing algorithms presented in the book. The book will be valuable to anyone interested in implementing distributed systems or client/server architectures.}
